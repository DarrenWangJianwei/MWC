The Property is able to further capitalize on the strong features of the market as well as the property itself by taking advantage of value-add opportunities. The current occupancy of 92% allows for leasing upside, as some of the currently vacant units are among the best located units in the shopping centre. There is also potential to expand the food court and introduce new kiosks, which could improve the quantity and quality of services in the mall, recapture common areas, and increase revenues. In addition, the current marketing program and building signage can be improved upon to potentially increase both traffic and sales. Long term redevelopment potential is also available, as the Property is located in an Urban Corridor that is targeted by the City for densified residential/mixed-use development.",
